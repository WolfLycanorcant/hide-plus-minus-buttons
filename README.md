# hide-plus-minus-buttons
Remove access to specific UI elements (e.g., adjustment buttons) for non-GM users by hiding them dynamically, even if they appear later due to application updates or interactions. This ensures that non-GM users cannot interact with these buttons, likely as a part of a UI/permission control feature in Foundry VTT.

# Hide Adjustment Buttons for Non-GM Users

This script is designed for use in Foundry Virtual Tabletop (Foundry VTT). It ensures that certain UI elements, specifically adjustment buttons (e.g., "+" and "-"), are hidden for all non-GM (Game Master) users. This feature can help enforce UI restrictions and maintain control over game settings or mechanics.

## How It Works


## Features

- **Non-GM Restriction**: Only affects users who are not designated as GMs.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Hides the targeted buttons even if they are added to the interface later.
- **Lightweight Solution**: Uses efficient DOM observation to achieve the functionality.

## Code Example

## Installation

1. Copy the contents into your Foundry VTT modules folder.
2. Ensure it is loaded with your game session by activating the addon.

## Use Case

This script is useful for:
- Enforcing role-specific UI restrictions in Foundry VTT.
- Preventing non-GM users from interacting with adjustment buttons or other elements that may affect game mechanics.
