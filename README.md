# hide-plus-minus-buttons
Remove access to specific UI elements (e.g., adjustment buttons) for non-GM users by hiding them dynamically, even if they appear later due to application updates or interactions. This ensures that non-GM users cannot interact with these buttons, likely as a part of a UI/permission control feature in Foundry VTT.
